# Executive Summary

## Overview
**InSAR-Toolbox** is an open-source toolkit that brings EGMS InSAR data **into ArcGIS** with **R** workflows. Inspired by the QGIS *InSAR Explorer* plugin, **InSAR-Toolbox** delivers similar functionality in the Esri environment: download/import EGMS products, interactively explore deformation on the map, make per-point time-series plots and group plots, run lightweight analyses (quality control, filtering, interpolation), and export figures for reporting.

## Goals
- **Integrate with ArcGIS**: a lightweight toolbox/add-in that feels native to ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online/Enterprise.
- **End-to-end EGMS workflows**: download/import → visualize → analyze (plots, group plots, interpolation) → export.
- **Reproducibility in R**: an R package that mirrors toolbox functions for scripted analyses.

## Methods
- **Tooling**: ArcGIS Pro toolbox/add-in for user workflows; R package `{insar}` for analysis/quality control and export.
- **Data I/O**: EGMS readers producing `sf`/`data.table` objects with preserved time index, units, etc.
- **Analytics**: robust trend analysis (regression, loess), outlier filtering, and spatial interpolation (IDW/kriging) for surface views.
- **ArcGIS integration**: R–ArcGIS Bridge bringing `{insar}` functionality into ArcGIS.
- **Quality**: reproducible examples, concise docs, and step-by-step tutorials.

## Expected Outcomes
- A working **ArcGIS toolbox/add-in** and a companion **R package** enabling hands-on EGMS InSAR analysis inside ArcGIS.
- Documented, reproducible workflows from **download → visualize → analyze → export**.

## Deliverables
1. **InSAR-Toolbox (ArcGIS toolbox/add-in)**  
   - EGMS import & data download helpers  
   - Symbology and pop-ups with key stats  
   - Per-point time-series and group plots with plot export
   - Publish time-enabled Feature Layers/Image Services
2. **R package `{insar}`**  
   - EGMS I/O; quality control, trend analysis, change-point utilities  
   - Interpolation helpers (IDW/kriging)  
   - Publishing helpers via R-ArcGIS Bridge
3. **Templates & Documentation**  
   - End-to-end tutorials + API reference/vignettes
4. **Sample Data & Reproducible Projects**  
   - Small EGMS subsets with pinned scripts; CI-verified examples

## Budget
Requested amount: **USD 20,000**.

The R package will provide functionality similar to the QGIS **InSAR Explorer** plugin: EGMS import, plotting, mapping/visualization, filtering, time-series plots, and interpolation.
