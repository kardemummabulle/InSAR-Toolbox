# Success

## Definition of done
- **Functionality (v1.0):**
  - InSAR-Toolbox (ArcGIS toolbox/add-in) supports EGMS download/import, per-point and group plots, QC/filtering, interpolation (IDW/kriging), plot export (PNG/SVG), and time-enabled layer publishing.
  - R package **`{insar}`** provides EGMS I/O, QC, trend utilities, interpolation, plotting helpers, and minimal publishing helpers.
- **Documentation:**
  - End-to-end tutorials, API reference.
- **Reproducibility & quality:**
  - Sample EGMS fixture in repo, deterministic examples, and automated CI.
- **Release:**
  - Tagged v1.0 with changelog and a short recorded walkthrough.

## Measuring success
- **User tasks (acceptance tests):**
  1. Import EGMS sample → create time-enabled layer → click a point → see correct time series.  
  2. Select AOI → generate group plot → export PNG.  
  3. Run `{insar}` script to reproduce the plot and apply QC flags.  
  4. Publish a time-enabled feature layer and open it in ArcGIS Online.
- **Adoption (within 3–6 months of v1.0):**
  - ≥3 external organizations run both tutorials end-to-end and provide feedback.
- **Performance:**
  - Per-point plot renders in ≤1 s on the sample dataset on a standard laptop; group plot ≤3 s for typical AOI (document dataset sizes/hardware).
- **Quality signals:**
  - Median issue time-to-first-response ≤5 business days; duplicated bug reports trending down after v1.0.
  - Zero blocking defects open >30 days.

## Future work
- **More analysis**: seasonality/acceleration checks and simple change-point flags with uncertainty hints.
- **Sharing**: ready-to-use ArcGIS Dashboard/Instant App examples.
- **Community**: clear CONTRIBUTING guide, “good first issue” labels, and periodic maintenance releases.
